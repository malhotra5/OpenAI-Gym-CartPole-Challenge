# CartPole challenge by OpenAI solved using NeuroEvolution
This example of neuroevolution was able to get a maximum score of 200 for all 100 consecutive trails. This method only shows basics of neuroevolution. This example does not use Deep Learning in any sort of way. This is a good way to start to get familiar with the comcepts behind neuroevolution. This project was able to run very well only after 4 generations. If you don't understand what that means, don't worry. This repository will tell you. 

## Getting Started 
To get this running, you need to clone only this part of the repository related to neuroevolution. 
### Prerequisites
You will need the following modules installed for python - 
* Gym (toolkit for developing reinforcement learning algorithms)
* Numpy (library that supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
* Random (pseudo-random number generators for various distributions)
* Statistics (optional - calculates mathematical statistics of numeric data)

### Installing
I have a tutorial for installing gym. This also includes other subsets of gym, such as the atari subset. The tutorial works for Windows too (especially Windows users who want atari games). To install the rest, use the following commands on the terminal - 

    pip install numpy

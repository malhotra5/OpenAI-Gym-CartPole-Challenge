# CartPole challenge by OpenAI solved using Feed Forward Neural Networks

## Getting Started 
To get this running, you need to clone only this part of the repository related to feed forward neural networks. 
### Prerequisites
You will need the following modules installed for python - 

* Gym (toolkit for developing reinforcement learning algorithms)
* Numpy (library that supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
* Tensorflow (symbolic math library for machine learning)
* Keras (nueral network library that runs over tensorflow)

### Installation
```
	pip install *packageName
```
The package names are specified in the prerequisites section

## Running the program

* The *main* function will create training data and train a neural network model
* The *testResults* function will test the model and print the score for it

## How it works 

Ask previously mentioned in the main directory of the this repo, the

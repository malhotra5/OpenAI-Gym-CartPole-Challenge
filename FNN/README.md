#CartPole challenge by OpenAI solved using Feed Forward Neural Networks

## Getting Started 
To get this running, you need to clone only this part of the repository related to feed forward neural networks. 
### Prerequisites
You will need the following modules installed for python - 

* Gym (toolkit for developing reinforcement learning algorithms)
* Numpy (library that supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
* Tensorflow (pseudo-random number generators for various distributions)
* Keras (optional - calculates mathematical statistics of numeric data)

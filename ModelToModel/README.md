# Training a Model using a Model
This was an experiment that I wanted to test. I used the simple model we trained from the Feed Forward Neural Network section of this repo. Using the predictions of that model, I wanted to train a more complex neural network.

**Results**: The more complex architecture seemed to perform better. 

**Further Improvements**: I want to test whether we can keep training more complex models by using the predictions of previous, simpler models.
